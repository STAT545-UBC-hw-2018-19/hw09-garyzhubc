make-activity
=============

This is an exercise of https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/make-activity.

You'll need packages such as ggplot2 stringr to run this pipeline.

In this submission, I explored start and end character association. 

I have added:

* `start_end.R` a function that exports frequency counts of start and end characters.

I have changed:

* `report.md` include an image called start_end.png.
* `Makefile` integrate start_end.R into the pipeline.
* `README.md` added description for this pipeline, including a flow chart of this pipeline as 'wow factor'.
